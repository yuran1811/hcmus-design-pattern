## Introduction

- Students will complete a final video project in groups on **Design Patterns**. This project requires groups to
  apply **Al-based tools** and **design patterns** to efficiently solve complex programming issues, improve code
  organization, and enhance software maintainability and extensibility. The aim is to help groups understand
  the correct use of design patterns, when to apply them, and how to use them effectively in practice.

## Objectives

1. **Understand and accurately apply object-oriented design patterns** to address specific software
   development problems.
2. **Improve object-oriented programming skills**, including class design, managing relationships
   between classes, and implementing flexible solutions.
3. **Develop a software design mindset** to produce maintainable, extensible, and reusable code.
4. **Apply design pattern theory** to build practical applications or simulate specific scenarios.

## Requirements

- Programming Language: C++.
- Identify the problem and select design patterns:
  - Using Al-based tools to brainstorm a problem or programming challenge that fits well with design
    patterns (e.g., managing objects, object creation, interactions between system components).
  - Propose and select **at least 3 design patterns** to apply in the solution (these may include
    Creational, Structural, and Behavioral patterns).
  - Explain why each design pattern was chosen and how it fits the problem.
  - Submission: Group's product includes:
  - A video `([group id]-[student ids].mp4)` presenting your project (duration `4' - 10'`)
  - A slide `([group id]-[student ids].pdf or .pptx)`
  - A report `([group id]-[student ids].pdf or .docx)`
